# Image Viewer Function for Matplotlib

This repository contains a Python function designed to display images using Matplotlib in their actual size. When using Matplotlib's default plt.show() method, images may not appear in their true dimensions. This function resolves that issue by ensuring the image is displayed at its original size.

To use this function, simply call **display(im_path)** and pass the path to your *image file* **(im_path)** as an argument.

This function ensures that images are displayed in their original dimensions, which is particularly useful for tasks where image size and aspect ratio are critical, such as in medical imaging, satellite imagery, or detailed visual inspections. It is very useful for almost all code work in computer vision, ensuring accurate representation of image data.
